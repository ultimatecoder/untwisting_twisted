  \section{Reactor}
  Reactor is the core of the event loop. It is responsible for waiting for the
  event and notify the program when the event is occurred. Reactor is dependent
  on platform specific libraries. Twisted will automatically choose default
  platform specific library.

  For under the hood details, In GNU/Linux platform it tries to fetch for epoll
  \cite{epoll}.  If epoll \cite{epoll} is not available, it will use poll
  \cite{poll}. All the POSIX compliant platforms it will use poll. All other
  platforms such as Windows and Macintosh it will use select reactor.

  You have to register your callbacks to the reactor and have to start it. Once
  the reactor is start, it will listen to the events and notifies to the
  program forever or until \texttt{reactor.stop} is called.
